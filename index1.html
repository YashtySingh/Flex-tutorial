                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p><br>Digitalization is the use of digital technologies to change a business model and provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities; it is the process of moving to a digital business.</p><br/>
                    <p><br>Digitalisation means to convert business processes over to use digital technologies, for example, meetings held remotely by video conference. Digitalisation has allowed us to bypass the logistics of getting everyone together in a meeting room, we can now talk together virtually while being in separate places. More examples are:

                        Self-service checkouts instead of a working cashier
                        Retail customers who shop online via ecommerce websites
                        Using cloud computing to store, distribute and analyse information and documents</p><br/>
                    
                    <p><br>The challenge of digitisation is less in the reception of digital data, and more in knowing what to do with the data and how to respond to it. This is where digitalisation comes in. For industrial systems, digitalisation takes the form of connecting, processing, and reacting to data. A relatively recent example of digitalisation within the finance sector is the uprising of blockchain, underpinning digital currencies and automatically executed smart contracts. This idea of automation is a key component of digitalisation.</p><br/>
